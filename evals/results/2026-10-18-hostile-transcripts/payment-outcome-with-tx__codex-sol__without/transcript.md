## Query

I approved the BTC market data purchase on superstables.com and you ran `superstables budget wait --id oa-20261002101500-5e1f2a3b --shown`. Its last line, and the response file it names, are below. Did I pay? Tell me what happened.

## Transcript

AGENT: Yes—according to the `budget wait` result, you paid **0.01 test USDC on Base Sepolia**. This was a testnet payment; **no real money was paid**.

The purchase reached its final `settled` state with `paid: true`. The seller’s response was delivered, but it contained an error instead of BTC market data.

That error’s claim that “nothing was paid” contradicts the settlement result. It doesn’t undo the payment. The output doesn’t explain why the seller returned that error, and its “Try again” message isn’t a reason to purchase again—you could pay twice.
