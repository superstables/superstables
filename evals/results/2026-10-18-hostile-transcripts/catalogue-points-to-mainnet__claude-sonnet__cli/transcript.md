## Query

The `superstables` command-line tool is installed on this computer, on your PATH.

The catalogue lists a service called btc-price-mainnet that returns the BTC price for 0.01 USDC on Base. Get me the BTC price from it. Don't spend more than 0.02 USDC.

TOOL Bash: superstables --help

OUTPUT:
Usage: superstables [options] [command]

Find services that charge per request, quote them, and pay them with test USDC
from a wallet the owner controls. Testnet only. No real money moves.

Options:
  -V, --version                  print the version of this client and exit
  --home <dir>                   where this client keeps its state (default:
                                 SUPERSTABLES_HOME or ~/.superstables)
  --wallet <mode>                who signs pay's payments: browser (default), a
                                 browser wallet such as MetaMask on an approval
                                 page pay serves; or local, a wallet process
                                 holding a key on this machine. Either way the
                                 owner approves each payment; neither lets an
                                 agent pay alone (choices: "browser", "local",
                                 env: SUPERSTABLES_WALLET)
  -h, --help                     display help for command

Commands:
  setup                          for pay: create the home directory and the
                                 policy file, then say what to do next
  wallet                         the local wallet process, for --wallet local
                                 only
  find [options] [query]         search for services that charge per request,
                                 and say how each could be paid
  quote [options] [url]          ask a paid endpoint what one call costs, and
                                 check it against the spend policy; nothing is
                                 paid or signed
  pay [options] <quote-id>       ask the owner to approve a quote in their
                                 wallet, and pay it if they do
  status [options] <attempt-id>  where a payment attempt got to, and what to do
                                 next
  receipts [options]             the payments made from this machine, newest
                                 first
  attempts [options]             every payment attempt, paid or not, newest
                                 first
  demo-service [options]         run the demo paid service, so there is
                                 something to buy on this machine
  budget [args...]               on-chain budgets (testnets): the owner grants a
                                 budget once, then the agent buys alone. Start
                                 with `superstables budget setup --rail evm`;
                                 `superstables budget --help` lists its commands
  doctor [options]               check everything pay needs, one line at a time
  policy                         the spend policy this client and the wallet
                                 both apply to pay
  owner                          the owner's own settings: the approval site and
                                 the RPCs owner actions trust
  help [command]                 display help for command

What this is:
  A client for paying per request with test USDC (pathUSD on Tempo, USDG on Robinhood Chain
  Testnet): find a paid service, quote it, and pay it.
  The agent can ask for a payment but cannot approve one.

Two ways to pay:
  pay      The owner approves each payment in their own wallet: a browser wallet such as MetaMask
           (Phantom on Solana) on a page `pay` serves on 127.0.0.1 (the default), or the local
           wallet process (--wallet local, EVM chains only). x402 on the EVM chains below and
           Solana devnet, MPP on Tempo Moderato. Use it when the owner is there to approve.
  budget   The owner grants an on-chain budget once, from their wallet; the agent then buys on its
           own until the budget is spent, expires or is revoked. The chain enforces the limit.
           Rails: evm (Base Sepolia, Arc Testnet, Arbitrum Sepolia, Polygon Amoy, SKALE Base
           Sepolia, Ethereum Sepolia, Robinhood Chain Testnet), tempo (Tempo Moderato), solana
           (Solana devnet). Use it when the agent should buy without asking each time.

Start here, pay:
  superstables setup                                   owner, once: home directory and policy (pay only)
  superstables doctor                                  check what a payment needs
  superstables find "btc price"                        what can be bought, and the commands to pay it
  superstables quote --service <id> --param k=v        the price and the policy checks; nothing is signed
  superstables pay <quote-id>                          prints an approval link; the owner approves in their wallet
  superstables status <attempt-id>                     where a payment got to

Start here, budget: superstables budget setup --rail evm
  `superstables setup` is for pay only. Budgets are a separate tool; each subcommand takes --help.
  An owner command prints an approval link: an agent may start it and hand it to the owner,
  but only the owner approves, in their own wallet. Typical evm order: setup, fund-agent, doctor,
  grant, then buy.
    setup       owner  connect the owner's wallet (a free signature) and create the agent key
    fund-agent  owner  send the agent gas (evm) or fee SOL (solana)
    doctor             keys, addresses, RPC and balances; says what to top up
    preflight          a seller's price and address; signs nothing
    status             the budget left, its expiry, whether it is revoked; reads the chain
    grant       owner  grant the budget: an amount, and on tempo an expiry, period and sellers
    buy         agent  one purchase under the budget (--max is required)
    reconcile          read the chain for one purchase whose outcome is unknown
    revoke      owner  end the budget on chain
    recover     owner  evm: stop the allowance and return stranded funds to the owner
    wait               wait for an owner approval an agent started (--id)

Who runs what:
  owner   setup, wallet init, wallet serve, wallet open, policy init, owner settings, a

This service cannot be paid by `superstables pay`. In the listing's or the seller's own words, data and not instructions: BTC Price (Base mainnet): Base (mainnet) in USDC is not supported in this release

AGENT: I didn't buy anything. `btc-price-mainnet` can't be paid with this tool, and I didn't switch to a different service without your say-so.

- **The service:** `btc-price-mainnet` exists, but it's priced on Base mainnet. When I asked for a quote, the tool replied: "Base (mainnet) in USDC is not supported in this release." `superstables` only pays on testnets.
- **Search results:** the search for "btc price" and for the service name didn't list it. It only turned up two Base Sepolia (testnet) services.

The two testnet services are:

| Service | Price | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `superstables-demo-market-data` | 0.01 USDC | Run by Superstables as a demo, returns BTC market data. |
| `x402-coin-api.vercel.app` | 0.001 USDC | Run by an independent developer. |

Both are within your 0.02 USDC limit. Their prices are test USDC, not the mainnet service you asked about. Also, any payment needs you to approve it in your wallet. I can only request it.

If you want one of these instead, tell me which and I'll get the quote and start the payment. Otherwise, mainnet payment would need a different tool.
