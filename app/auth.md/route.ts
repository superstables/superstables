## Overview

The Superstables Index API and MCP server are public and read-only. No authentication,
no API key, no OAuth. CORS is open.

## Endpoints

- REST: ${SITE}/api/v1/services (spec: ${SITE}/openapi.json)
- MCP (streamable HTTP): ${SITE}/api/mcp

## Rate limits

Soft advisory limit of 300 requests per minute per client (RateLimit headers on responses).
Responses are CDN-cached for 300 seconds; there is no benefit to polling faster.

## Write operations

The only write is POST /api/v1/submit (suggest a service for listing). It is unauthenticated
and goes to a moderation queue; nothing is published without an independent liveness probe.
